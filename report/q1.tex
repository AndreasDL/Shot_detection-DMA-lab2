\section[Pseudo-code and explanatory notes for the video shot detection method implemented
in Exercise 5.]{}\label{Q1}
The implemented method for exercise 5 is the Twin Comparison method\footnote{Based on 'Dissolve Detection Based On Twin-Comparison With Curve Fitting' by Yu et al.}. This method is based on the differences between the local histograms of subsequent frames. If the difference exceeds an upper threshold, this is seen as a hard cut. When the difference does not exceed the upper threshold, but exceeds a lower threshold, this frame is seen as the start of a possible soft cut. From then on, the differences of the next frames will be cumulatively summed. If this sum exceeds the higher threshold before a single frame-to-frame difference is lower than the lower threshold, a soft cut is detected.
